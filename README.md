# Overview

A collection of numerical methods and data structures I most often use in my projects. The `utilities` module contains various basic functions and algorithms. The `random` module implements random number generation, using hardware random numbers if available for the CPU, and sampling from various distributions. The `index` module is a class that can be used to relate elements to groups they belong to, similar to the factor in R. I have been using these utilities in several projects, so they are fairly well tested.

## Including in your project

If you want to try these out, you can include them in your project by running

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/tonymugen/bayesicUtilities [optional local name]
```

Interface documentation is [available here](https://bayesicresearch.org/software/bayesicutilities).
